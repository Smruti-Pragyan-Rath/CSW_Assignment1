    <h1><em><strong>S = vᵢt + ½at²: The Equation of Linear
                Motion</strong></em> </h1>

    <p>The formula S = vᵢt + ½at² describes the motion of an object under constant
        acceleration. Here: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><i>S</i> represents the displacement, </li>
        <li><i>v</i>is the initial velocity, </li>
        <li><i>t</i> s the time, , </li>
        <li><i>a</i> is the acceleration, and </li>
        <li><i>½at²</i> is the additional displacement due to acceleration. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>"An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an <u>external force</u>."
        Note: This equation was originally written
        in 1905.
